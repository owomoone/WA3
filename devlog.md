# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)
> For this week I had only planned to finish the proposal since there were many exams this week and in the following two weeks, and I accomplished this.
> Initially I had planned to do another project for this WA3 but I realised it would take too much time to code everything until it was decent, so I changed my idea to a simpler one that still utilises OOP and requires some research.

## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)
> I planned to begin on coding and finishing at least the initial game rules page, but I had to revise for my exams and thus did not work on anything of the sort. For the next week I plan to finish the starting set-up, as well as work on the actual Card, Deck and Playerhand classes.

## Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)
> (as of 10/8) I have accomplished all that I have planned for the week, including coding all the necessary functions for the three classes. I have begun coding the recognition of valid card plays and moves, but it may take longer than expected since the game I am coding had many accepted plays. For the next week, I plan to start working on the actual logic of the game: valid card moves (in the sense that the card played is of the same type as the previous play, and beats it), warning systems, as well as trying to optimise interface such that it is decent enough (if time and energy allows).

## Week 8 (16 Aug - 22 Aug)

## Week 9 (23 Aug - 29 Aug)

## Week 10 (30 Aug - 5 Sep)

## Sep Holiday (5 Sep - 10 Sep) **Submission date is 10 Sep**
