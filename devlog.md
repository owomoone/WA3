# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)
> For this week I had only planned to finish the proposal since there were many exams this week and in the following two weeks, and I accomplished this.
> Initially I had planned to do another project for this WA3 but I realised it would take too much time to code everything until it was decent, so I changed my idea to a simpler one that still utilises OOP and requires some research.

## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)
> I planned to begin on coding and finishing at least the initial game rules page, but I had to revise for my exams and thus did not work on anything of the sort. For the next week I plan to finish the starting set-up, as well as work on the actual Card, Deck and Playerhand classes.

## Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)
> I have accomplished all that I have planned for the week, including coding all the necessary functions for the three classes. I have begun coding the recognition of valid card plays and moves, but it may take longer than expected since the game I am coding had many accepted plays. For the next week, I plan to start working on the actual logic of the game: valid card moves (in the sense that the card played is of the same type as the previous play, and beats it), warning systems, as well as trying to optimise interface such that it is decent enough (if time and energy allows).
> I did not achieve the plans for further action detailed above, because time and energy did not allow. :(

## Week 8 (16 Aug - 22 Aug)
> I am updating this (and the following section) on 28th August because I honestly forgot about doing the development log. I have also forgotten exactly what I achieved and planned for this week, but I believe I finished coding about three quarters of play validity recognition but did not do much else.

## Week 9 (23 Aug - 29 Aug)
> In this week, I planned to finish recognition of valid moves and begin on further logic (in regards to previous play magnitude and type). This was achieved swiftly because all my examinations were over and I only had one or two weighted submissions left, so I also began on exception handling (both try-except and while loops) after completing my objectives. I will likely not be able to work on the code tomorrow (29th August) due to CCA until 6.45pm, but I will try to work on it at night (if time and energy allows). Referring to my original proposal, so far Goals 1, 2, 3 and 6 have been achieved, although I have already thought of simple ways to make Goals 4, 5, 7 and 8 work: it's just a matter of whether I procrastinate actual coding or not. :P

## Week 10 (30 Aug - 5 Sep)
> I did not do much work this week as I was practicing for a Chinese Orchestra ensemble, though I think I did some work but did not update devlog as I had forgotten to. Next week I plan to finish my whole code.

## Sep Holiday (5 Sep - 10 Sep) **Submission date is 10 Sep**
> This week I completed the whole code, finishing exception handling, the whole game process, file I/O,  resetting the game, display and everything, the project is done.
