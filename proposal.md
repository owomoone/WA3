# General description of project
> the project is about programming the game of 掼蛋 / Guandan, a poker game originating from china. it involves
> a deck of 108 poker cards: 8 x {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A} & 2 x {Black Joker, Red Joker}
> 
> the game is 2v2, with players taking alternating turns. it implements a level system, where the current "level" represents the largest card out of all cards excluding the Jokers. players can increase their team's level by winning games (i.e. one player plays all their cards first), though the increase depends on the other teammate's position. upon reaching the level where A is the greatest card, if one of the team players go first and the other does not go last, they win the game. other playing rules and conditions for winning will be explained within the coded version of the game (hopefully).

#Goals of project
> by importance:
> 1. basic game set-up, rules and guidelines of the game
> 2. sort out the deck, as well as its shuffling, distributing and sorting systems
> 3. figure out a reliable way of hiding one's hand (i.e. preventing opponents from seeing your cards)
> 4. implement a way to group cards (i.e. if a player has a combination of cards that can be played together, they can place them into a separate group)
> 5. undo or ungroup functions
> 6. option to actually play cards
> 7. additional game interface details (i.e. warnings when a certain player goes below a fixed number of cards)
> 8. way to save current game progress for further playing
> 9. better card display and illustration on the screen

# Listing of features
> 1. rules page to brief players on how to play the game
> 2. cards in hand arranged by ranks and suits
> 3. functions to play, group, undo/ungroup cards
> 4. clear game interface (i hope)
> 5. save progress option

# External Scanning
> some mobile games offer the Guandan experience but i am unable to find actual code for the game online.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> mainly for entertainment, when someone wants to play the game but does not have a physical deck of cards.

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> figure out how to make decent graphics, as well as saving progress for further use.
