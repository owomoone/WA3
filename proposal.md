# General description of project
> a zombie apocalypse is occuring :( <br>the zombies get stronger and the amount gets greater as the days pass <br>the objective of the game is to create a light shield out of materials to be obtained in order to successfully ward out the zombies from your country. <br>these materials must be obtained through mining in caves or adventuring in forests, both of which contain significantly more zombies than at the heart of the country, where you reside (for now). <br>certain materials can also / only be obtained through shops with money obtained from selling resources or unneeded materials. <br>you have to purchase additional weapons to defend yourself from the zombies to survive.

#Goals of project
> by importance: <br>1. figure out all the variables and general parameters of the game (e.g. ammunition, initial money, locations) <br>2. code the shop's systems <br>3. code the death and zombie combat systems, taking into account variables <br>4. code the mining and foraging systems<br>5. implement some way to save user progress <br>6. rework everything because something's definitely going to break <br>7. implement visual/graphic maps of the locations ("neighbourhood", caves, forests) <br>8. work out better user interface (though this can be done slowly during other steps as well)

# Listing of features
> 1. UI (Ammunition, Health, Money, Current Location, Inventory) <br>
> 2. Shop/Trading (Materials, Restock, Price List, Random Events) <br>
> 3. Combat (Kill Luck, Weapon Specifics, Enemy Speed/Health) <br>
> 4. Caves + Forest (RNG Resource Obtainment, Use of Tools, Zombie Spawn Chance) <br>
> 5. Some resemblance of a storyline <br>

# External Scanning
> I couldn't find many zombie apocalypse games, though I did find multiple zombie apocalypse data simulators which aren't very helpful for the project

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> entertainment probably

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> figure out how to make good-looking graphics, as well as facilitate smooth gameplay and keeping account information for repeated use
